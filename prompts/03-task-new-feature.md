## First prompt

I'd like to add additional options for tasks:
- a field with the due date
- a field with the person assigned to the task
All fields are optional.

In addition, if a task is overdue, it should be highlighted on the board.

Assign a team agent with all the necessary teammates. A list of available teammates is in the CLAUDE.md file.
Use Sonnet for all teammates.
First, plan the implementation method, and then make any necessary changes.

## Second prompt

There's a problem with card alignment. Once fixed, run thorough frontend and backend tests. See the screen. Use team agents to resolve this issue.  

## Third prompt

There's a problem with card alignment. The problem is when I use drag'n'drop to move card. Fix this, tests and add appropriate tests for the future. Use team agents to resolve this issue.

## Fourth prompt

There is still this same problem. I create two card in first column and one in second. When I try drag one card from first column to second alignment doesn't work. The problem arose after changes in this branch.

## Fifth prompt (new context, Opus)

I have a problem with drag'n'drop. I have two card in first column and one in second (first screen). When I move first card from first column, card alignment is broken (second screen). Resolve this issue using agent teams. 
Add appropriate tests for the future.
